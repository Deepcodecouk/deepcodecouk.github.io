I'm still in the process of moving my blog to github pages, using octopress. In my [previous post]({% my_post 2014-05-18-Moving-my-blog-to-github-pages-part-2%}) I covered the basics of publishing your repo and generated site to github.

This third post turns attention to converting all my existing blog content that is currently hosted on blogger.com. It's not a massive blog, with only 115 or so posts, but still, some of them are quite lengthy and I want to pull them all down and convert them to markdown without having to cut/paste them all or, god forbid, re-create them.
