As I mentioned in my previous posts, I've decided to move my blog to github pages and use octopress. 

Now that we've got octopress running, can author new content, and can get it published to github, this third post turns attention to converting all my existing blog content that is currently hosted on blogger.com. It's not a massive blog, with only 115 or so posts, but still, some of them are quite lengthy and I want to pull them all down and convert them to markdown without having to cut/paste them all or, god forbid, re-create them.
